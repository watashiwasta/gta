If the franchise needed a reason to push through with such a decision, then it only has to look at <a href="https://gamerant.com/french-president-emmanuel-macron-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall/" target="_blank">the success of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>.</p>                    ]]></content:encoded><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 00:30:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://gamerant.com/kingdom-hearts-clair-obscur-expedition-33-non-square-enix-rpgs-why/</guid></item>                                                                <item><title><![CDATA[Prey 2 May Never Happen, But Judas Could Be the Next Best Thing]]></title><link>https://gamerant.com/prey-2-no-sequel-judas-similar-arkane/</link><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ediz Guner]]></dc:creator><enclosure url="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/prey-2-judas-game-rant.jpg" length="554" type="image/jpeg"/><category><![CDATA[Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Prey]]></category><category><![CDATA[Judas]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arkane Studios]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bethesda]]></category><category><![CDATA[Zenimax Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></category><category><![CDATA[Take-Two Interactive]]></category><category><![CDATA[PlayStation]]></category><category><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></category><category><![CDATA[PlayStation 5]]></category><category><![CDATA[Xbox]]></category><category><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></category><category><![CDATA[Xbox Series X]]></category><category><![CDATA[Xbox Series S]]></category><category><![CDATA[PC]]></category><category><![CDATA[FPS]]></category><description><![CDATA[
